# Garage
Excercise, C#.NET MVC Lexicon 2017. Withour accounts. UI in Swedish.<br />
A very good example of how a system should work, no dead ends!<br />
You don't need to use the menu.<br />
Later I wrote an improved code (https://github.com/StefLove/Garage)<br />
that really works better, it is posted on http://garage.stefan-l√∂vefors.se.
