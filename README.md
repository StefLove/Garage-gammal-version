# Garage
Excercise, C#.NET MVC Lexicon 2017. Withour accounts. UI in Swedish.
A very good example of how a system should work, no dead ends!
You don't need to use the menu.
Later I wrote an improved code (https://github.com/StefLove/Garage),
that really works better,<br />it is posted on http://garage.stefan-l√∂vefors.se.
